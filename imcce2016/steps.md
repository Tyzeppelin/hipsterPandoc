## Steps of factorization of univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}$ [x]


$f \in \mathbb{Z} [x]$

\\/

$f \in \mathbb{F}_q [x], deg(f) = n$

\\/ turn f into a squarefree polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_q$ (using Yun's algorithm(?))

$f_1,..., f_n \in \mathbb{F}_q [x]$ so that $f = f_1...f_n$

\\/ "distinct degree" or produce a set as following

$f^{[d]}, ..., f^{[n]} \in \mathbb{F}_q [x]$ so that for $1 \leq d \leq n$ , $f^{[d]}$ is a product of monic irreducible factor of f of degree d

\\/ "equal degree" or produce a factorization of f in $\mathbb{F}_q [x]$ [see @von2001factoring]

${f_1, ..., f_k}$ set of irreducible factors of f in $\mathbb{F}_q [x]$

\\/ Hensel lift (?) / find true fators of f in $\mathbb{Z} [x]$

a factorization of f in $\mathbb{Z} [x]$
