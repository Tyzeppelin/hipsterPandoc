Summary
=======

In the end, this internship made me discover the world of research by working on a 
thesis project. This project, melange, taught me the basics of model engineering,
an IT field I barely knew. Shoutout to Thomas Degueule for having spend a lot of time
explaining me what a language is and how melange is working.

Moreover, it has been a technical challenge; I had to learn a new lanaguage syntax, xtend, and a
new environnement, Eclipse RCP. What stays in my mind is that xtend is a sexy way of doing Java
and it helps focusing on modeling and design because of its powerful yet simple syntax.
(Lambdas expressions are a great example)

On the contrary, the Eclipse Rich Client Platform is really heavy and not accessible.
The main problem is the lack of documentation about its behaviour, especially when
you want to customize thing generated by xtext/emf. This have slowed down the developpement
because each time I wanted to work on a new feature, I had to do some archeology and try to
understand how things work.

To sum up in a few words, the internship has been very enriching intellectually and taught me
the basics of model-driven engineering.
